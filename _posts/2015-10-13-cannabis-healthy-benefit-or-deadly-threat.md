description: 'When the first controls on cannabis were introduced in the UK, few people had ever heard of it. Occasionally a foreign visitor would be arrested with hashish - but only because it was mistaken for the much more notorious opium. Apart from the odd tabloid scare, few saw cannabis as a serious threat.'
